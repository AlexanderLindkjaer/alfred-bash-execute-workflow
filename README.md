Trigger the workflow with the keyword ``bash`` followed by the file you are searching for.
Hit enter and it will open Iterm2, cd to the path and execute the script.

##Note
This workflow uses [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) instead of the default mac terminal. Make a issue/PR if you need support for normal terminal.
